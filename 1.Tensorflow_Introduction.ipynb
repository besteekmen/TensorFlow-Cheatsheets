It then uses the __optimizer__ function to make a better guess by trying to minimize the loss. Below, [mean squared error](https://keras.io/api/losses/regression_losses/#meansquarederror-function) for the loss and [stochastic gradient descent](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/sgd/) for the optimizer is used.
